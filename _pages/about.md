Hey there! I'm Wei Han. I'm an MSc. student at the University of Alberta specializing in Systematics and Evolution.

I completed my BSc. at the University of Toronto with a double major in EEB and Conservation Biology.

When I'm not working on beetles, I enjoy hiking, running, and playing football [the real sort ;)]
