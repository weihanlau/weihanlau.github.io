Hey there! My name is Wei Han and I'm an MSc student in the [Sperling Lab](https://sperlinglab.wordpress.com/) at the University of Alberta specializing in Systematics and Evolution. 

My research at the lab involves the use of genomic markers to identify the genetic population structure of the threatened Big Sand Tiger Beetle (_Cicindela formosa_) across North America. I am also interested in the evolution of elytral colour patterns within Coleoptera, and I am hoping to shed some light on the evolutionary forces driving and maintaining the diverse (and stunning!) array of elytral colour patterns within _C. formosa_ by combining genomic data with methods in image-segmentation.

I completed my BSc at the University of Toronto in 2023 with a double major in EEB and Conservation Biology. During my time as an undergraduate, I worked and volunteered at natural history museums in Canada and Singapore, and the experience of working within natural history collections are ones that I deeply cherish. Currently, I am broadly interested in topics in insect systematics and taxonomy, the evolution of colour, collections-based research, and biodiversity genomics.

When I'm not working on beetles, I enjoy running, hiking in the backcountry, and playing football (only the real sort ðŸ˜‰). Come on you Gunners!
