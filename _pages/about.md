Hey there! My name is Wei Han and I'm an MSc. student in the Sperling Lab at the University of Alberta specializing in Systematics and Evolution. My research involves using genomic markers to identify the genetic population structure of the threatened Big Sand Tiger Beetle (_Cicindela formosa_) across North America. I am also extremely interested in the evolution of elytral colour patterns within Coleoptera, and I am hoping to shed some light on the evolutionary forces driving and maintaining the stunning and diverse array of elytral colour patterns within _C. formosa_ by combining genomic data with methods in image-segmentation. 

I completed my BSc. at the University of Toronto with a double major in EEB and Conservation Biology. During my time as an undergraduate, I worked and volunteered at natural history museums in Canada and Singapore. Natural history collections are extremely important historical biological datsets, and I have a passion for collections-based research. 

When I'm not working on beetles, I enjoy running, backpacking, and playing football [the real sort ;)].
